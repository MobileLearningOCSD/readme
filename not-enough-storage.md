### Signing out
~~~
Signing a student out of an iPad normally takes about 15 minutes; to offload their metrics and user data.
Attempting to sign in a new student during the offload will create the Not Enough Storage modal to appear.

Signing out removes student data from the iPad.
Signing in a new student requires a specific amount of free space.
~~~

### Try this first
~~~
1. Ensure the iPad is connected to cnet2.
2. Wait 15 minutes.
~~~

### What now?
Cannot sign student in after 15 minutes AND the device is connected to cnet2?</br>
Create [iPad Setup Request](https://ms.960design.com/) letting us know about a "stuck" account and the the deviceID.<br>
We will forcefully remove the student data from the device as long as the device is charged to over 50% and connected to cnet2.  This will result in a loss of metrics and other student data.

### Why is this happening?
Student metrics may not have been downloaded regularly:
- weekly ( KG - 02 ) or 
- daily ( for all others ).

This can create a significant amount of data on how the student uses the iPad.  We have seen over 10GB of metrics stored on a single student that has not logged out of their device for several months.  10GB of data will take about 24 hours to offload; as long as the device is plugged in and over 50%.
